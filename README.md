This is the github repository for the CSC 363 Pediatric game named chartwork to be designed for ST. Lukes Hospital.
This game runs off of Unity and has a website used to download it based off of the react coding language.
The game is a puzzle game made for children 3-5 composed of matching pieces of various organs until the organ is complete.
It then uses bright colors and a fun font to try and educate the children not only on the whole organ but the various parts that they matched together.
